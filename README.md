> ðŸš€ This project simulates gravitational waveforms from the Entropic Coherence Gravity (ECG) model and validates them against real LIGO detections, including GW150914.

# ECG-Waveform-Lab

Simulation and waveform comparison toolkit for the Entropic Coherence Gravity (ECG) model. Includes synthetic waveform generation, LIGO data overlays, and coherence-based gravitational analysis.
